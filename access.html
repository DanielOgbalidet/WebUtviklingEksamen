                We wanted to optimize the website from the very beginning of this project. Everything from colors to font and font size.
                By implementing this from the first day, we prevent problem that may appear when changing the code to meet the requirements to make the site accessible. 
                We decided to use the colors beige, white and black to create a contrast for an easier reading experience for color bind people. 
                Therefore, we think choosing the right colors make a huge difference for accessibility. 
                We have also chosen to keep the site simple with only the most essential features to not make the user feel overwhelmed.
                The user experience will improve by an easier and more intuitive site.
                By focusing on accessibility from day one, we think we were able to make the most optimal solution so that most people can enjoy our web page.
                Down below you will be able to see our result taken from validator.w3.org and jigsaw.w3.org.
